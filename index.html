	 The ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation of key molecules involved in the regulation of a cell's response to DNA damage has become an important area of research for therapy of cancers.  We focus on ubiquitylation / deubiquitylation pathways related to the DNA replication apparatus and in the dysregulation of DNA damage response induced by viral oncoproteins.

    <div class = "textBox3">
    <div class="heading"><a href="noncodingrna.html">Non-coding RNAs</a></div><br>
 	Short and long noncoding RNAs are turning out to be very important for various facets of biology.  We study them in the context of how they regulate differentiation of skeletal muscle and the progression of prostate cancer.
 	</div>
 	
    <div class = "textBox2">
    <div class="heading"><a href="genomic.html">Genomic Instability</a></div><br>
    With the revolution of genomic sequencing, questions relating to where origins of replication are located, what genes are important for cancer progression or for prediction of responsiveness to chemotherapy, and whether there are new forms of nucleic acid molecules in the cell or in our body fluids have become easier to access.  We take a leading role in these areas of exploration.

	 <div class = "resInt"><div class="aboutme"><b>About Dr. Dutta</b></div><br>
	 <div class = "resIntText"> His research interests cover genomic instability in cancer cells and noncoding RNAs in differentiation and cancer. His laboratory identified many of the replication initiation proteins in human cells, used genomics technology to identify hundreds of origins of replication in human chromosomes, discovered a major mechanism by which human cells prevent over-replication of their DNA, and identified a novel class of circular DNA present in normal mammalian cells His laboratory has also discovered many microRNAs that inhibit cell proliferation and promote differentiation during the conversion of muscle stem cells to mature muscle and microRNAs that contribute to the phenotypes of advanced prostate cancer. He has trained over thirty scientists who continue research in academia or industry, and has received the following honors: Elected Fellow of the AAAS, Ranbaxy Award for studies on genome instability and the Outstanding Investigator Award of the American Society for Investigative Pathology.
